Frontend Web Development task for CSI Interviews 2023

This is a frontend web development project that I have made as a part of
the CSI Interviews in August-September of 2023.

Install both the HTML and CSS files in the same folder to ensure the site
runs properly.

I have made attempts to make the website work on screens of varying
dimensions but have failed to make a working prototype for screens that
are the size of mobile phones.

For the CSI member reading through this:

The Images provided as part of the Assets in the task are not included
because I have used hyperlinks to the images, and as a result only the html
file and the CSS file are in the repository.
